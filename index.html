        <h1>Wooden Katana</h1>
        <hr/>

        <h2>This is how I made my own Katana</h2>
        

        <h3>What inspired me to do this?</h3>
        <p>Ever since I watched Demon Slayer animation I always wanted to own a Katana like every character in the series. Eventhough the market for this merchendise is huge my pocket isn't, so I decided to make one my own.</p>

        <h3>My first Katana</h3>
        <p>It was during quarantine when I made my first katana which turned out really cool. Still it's small comparing to real ones and it does not have any finishing. Later after few months I made another one which looked similar to the first one but has those little details.</p>

        <h3>My best work</h3>
        <p>After some long time I decided to make a full fleged katana(wooden ofcourse) with all the experience I gained so far and was finally able to make one which is almost identical to practice katanas.</p>

        <p>It was really tough to make one on my own especially with no tools. That's right only tools I used in this project was a blade with no handle and few sandpapers, it was a horror since I had no experience working with wood and I was hoping it to turn out well and it did. </p>

        <h3>Design and measurements</h3>
        <p>Here are some pictures related to design work of the project.</p>

                    <li>100X3X1 cm wood x1</li>
                    <li>30X3X0.5 cm wood x2</li>
                    <li>Glue</li>
                    <li>Paper tape</li>
                    <li>Wood polish</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Tools</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Handsaw</li>
                    <li>Sand papers (a bunch)</li>
                    <li>Files (if any)</li>
                    <li>Clips</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps to follow</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mark the measurements and design on wood before cutting.</li>
            <li>Cut along the edges of markings.</li>
            <li>Using any adhesive glue make handle of katana by gluing </br>the small wooden pieces at both sides.</li>
            <li>Use clips to hold the pieces tight and leave no air gaps.</li>
            <li>After the piece is hard sand the edges and make the edge of </br>blade as sharp as possible.</li>
            <li>And for final touch polish the wood with a cloth and rest it </br>for few hours.</li>
        </ol>
